Describe what Lab1 was about:
This lab is about an incomplete DBMS. It doesn't support backup, index, multi thread
even unable to really make a query (There is no query functions).
The purpose of this lab is to make the basic parts for a very simply DBMS

Describe the various components that you implemented and how they work:
Tuples: The smallest components in side a database, tuples and one TupleDesc make up a table.
Since each table has a fixed schema for all its tuples, so each table is associate with one TupleDesc.

Catalog: I think Catalog is the database of the DBMS, it store all the tables and their TupleDesc.
Thus, each DBMS only has one Catalog.

BufferPool: A place to store the most recent used data(Pages). HeapFile always ask BufferPool for pages first.
If the page isn't store in BufferPool, it will call HeapFile to get that page, and return to HeapFile.
BufferPool has a fixed size, if no more free space for the new page, it will delete the older page based on its policy.

HeapFile page: HeapFile made by HeapPages, and HeapPage made by Tuples. Each page has the same size and contains
a TupleDesc for their associate HeapFile. Thus, depend on the TupleDesc size, the number of Tuples each Page can hold
might be different.

Heap File: Each table has its own HeapFile, but their raw data were stored in a file.
Everytime when a new table is added to the Database, it will convert the file to HeapFile, then add to the Catalog.

SeqScan Operators: The lowest operator of a DBMS, it will iterate the associated for output results.



Describe any design decisions you made:
I always use ConcurrentHashMap to store data whenever I saw a ConcurrentHashMap import.


One example of a unit test:
Add a test to check the getHeaderSize() method in HeapPage Class.
I passed all HeapPageIdTest, RecordIdTest, and HeapPageReadTest but after I completed SeqScan.java,
I failed on the ScanTest. It said some array index out of range error and spend me a long time to
find the bug was in the getHeaderSize() method.


Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API:
No

Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code:
The getPage method in BufferPool Class has a TransactionId and a Permission parameter,
but I didn't use them in this lab.
Also, many of the Class should contain a Locker or use TransactionId and Permission but i didn't implement them either.
